# URL Deduplication Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of URL deduplication for the news aggregator system. The solution ensures that articles with duplicate URLs are not saved multiple times, even when scraped on different dates.

## Problem Addressed
- The database was allowing duplicate articles with the same URL to be saved when scraped on different dates
- This created redundant entries and cluttered the database with the same article content

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File**: `app/models/models.py`

- Added `unique=True` constraint to the `source_url` column in the News model
- This ensures database-level enforcement of URL uniqueness
- Titles are allowed to be duplicate (only URLs must be unique)

```python
source_url = Column(Text, nullable=False, unique=True)  # Make URLs unique
```

### 2. Application Logic Updates
**Files**: 
- `app/main.py` (both `fetch_news` and `fetch_news_by_date` functions)
- `app/services/news_service.py`

#### Changes Made:
- **URL-only deduplication**: Modified logic to check only for duplicate URLs, not titles
- **Cross-date checking**: Duplicate detection now works across all dates, not just within the same date
- **Graceful error handling**: Database constraint violations are caught and logged appropriately
- **Improved response messages**: APIs now return counts of new articles, duplicates skipped, and total processed

#### Before:
```python
# Only checked within same date
existing = db.query(News).filter(
    News.source_url == article['source_url'],
    News.collection_date == date_obj
).first()
```

#### After:
```python
# Checks across all dates, URL only
existing_by_url = db.query(News).filter(News.source_url == article['source_url']).first()

if existing_by_url:
    duplicate_count += 1
    logger.info(f"Skipping duplicate URL: {article['source_url']}")
    continue
```

### 3. Database Migration
**File**: `migrate_url_uniqueness.py`

- Created migration script to safely add unique constraints to existing database
- Removes any existing duplicate URLs (keeping the oldest entry)
- Handles the schema transformation without data loss
- Includes verification and testing of the unique constraint

#### Migration Results:
- **Initial articles**: 994
- **Duplicates found**: 0 (database was already clean)
- **Final articles**: 994
- **Status**: Migration completed successfully

### 4. Error Prevention
The implementation includes multiple layers of protection:

1. **Application-level checks**: Before attempting to save
2. **Database constraints**: Enforced at the database level
3. **Exception handling**: Graceful handling of constraint violations
4. **Rollback support**: Transactions are rolled back on errors

### 5. API Response Improvements
The fetch endpoints now return more detailed information:

```json
{
    "message": "Successfully processed articles for 2023-12-01: 5 new, 2 updated, 3 duplicates skipped",
    "new_articles": 5,
    "updated_articles": 2,
    "duplicates_skipped": 3,
    "total_processed": 10
}
```

## Testing
Comprehensive testing was performed to verify:

✅ **Unique constraint enforcement**: Duplicate URLs are rejected by the database  
✅ **Application logic**: Duplicate URLs are detected and skipped before database insertion  
✅ **Title duplicates allowed**: Articles with same titles but different URLs are permitted  
✅ **Error handling**: Constraint violations don't cause internal server errors  
✅ **Cross-date deduplication**: URLs are unique across all collection dates  

## Benefits
1. **Data integrity**: No duplicate articles in the database
2. **Storage efficiency**: Reduces database size and improves performance
3. **User experience**: Cleaner article listings without duplicates
4. **Maintenance**: Easier data management and reporting
5. **Error prevention**: Robust error handling prevents application crashes

## Files Modified
- `app/models/models.py` - Added unique constraint
- `app/main.py` - Updated deduplication logic in both fetch functions
- `app/services/news_service.py` - Updated service-level deduplication
- `migrate_url_uniqueness.py` - Database migration script

## Migration Instructions
If deploying to a new environment:

1. Run the migration script: `python migrate_url_uniqueness.py`
2. Verify the constraints are in place
3. Test the application endpoints

The system is now fully protected against URL duplicates while maintaining all existing functionality.
