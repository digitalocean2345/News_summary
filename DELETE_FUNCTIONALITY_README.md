# Delete Functionality for Categories and Comments

This document describes the new delete functionality that has been added to the News Summary application.

## Overview

Two new delete endpoints have been added to allow users to delete categories and comments:

1. **Delete Categories**: Remove categories along with all associated saved summaries and comments
2. **Delete Comments**: Remove individual comments

## API Endpoints

### Delete Category

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/categories/{category_id}`

**Description**: Deletes a category and all its associated data (saved summaries and comments).

**Parameters**:
- `category_id` (int): The ID of the category to delete

**Response**:
```json
{
    "message": "Category 'Category Name' deleted successfully",
    "deleted_saved_summaries": 5,
    "deleted_comments": 12
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `404`: Category not found
- `500`: Server error during deletion

### Delete Comment

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/comments/{comment_id}`

**Description**: Deletes a specific comment.

**Parameters**:
- `comment_id` (int): The ID of the comment to delete

**Response**:
```json
{
    "message": "Comment deleted successfully",
    "deleted_comment": {
        "id": 123,
        "news_id": 456,
        "comment_text": "This is a sample comment...",
        "user_name": "TestUser",
        "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00"
    }
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `404`: Comment not found
- `500`: Server error during deletion

## Implementation Details

### Backend Implementation

1. **Main Application (`app/main.py`)**:
   - Added `DELETE /api/categories/{category_id}` endpoint
   - Added `DELETE /api/comments/{comment_id}` endpoint

2. **Category Endpoints (`app/api/category_endpoints.py`)**:
   - Added `DELETE /{category_id}` endpoint for better organization

### Database Operations

When deleting a category:
1. Counts associated saved summaries and comments
2. Deletes all saved summaries linked to the category
3. Deletes all comments linked to the category
4. Deletes the category itself
5. Returns summary of deleted items

When deleting a comment:
1. Verifies comment exists
2. Stores comment information for response
3. Deletes the comment
4. Returns confirmation with deleted comment details

### Frontend Integration

The templates have been updated to include delete buttons:

1. **Category Management** (`app/templates/comments_by_category.html`):
   - Added delete buttons (üóëÔ∏è) for each category card
   - JavaScript function `deleteCategory()` handles deletion with confirmation

2. **Comment Management** (`app/templates/category_comments.html`):
   - Added delete buttons (üóëÔ∏è) for each comment
   - JavaScript function `deleteComment()` handles deletion with confirmation

### Safety Features

1. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Users must confirm deletion actions
2. **Cascade Deletion**: When deleting categories, all related data is properly cleaned up
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed operations
4. **Transaction Safety**: Database rollback on errors

## Usage Examples

### Using the API Directly

```bash
# Delete a category
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/categories/1

# Delete a comment
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/comments/123
```

### Using the Web Interface

1. **Delete Category**:
   - Go to the Comments page (`/comments`)
   - Click the üóëÔ∏è button on any category card
   - Confirm the deletion in the dialog

2. **Delete Comment**:
   - Go to a specific category's comments page
   - Click the üóëÔ∏è button next to any comment
   - Confirm the deletion in the dialog

## Testing

A test script `test_delete_functionality.py` has been created to verify the delete functionality:

```bash
python test_delete_functionality.py
```

This script tests:
- Category creation and deletion
- Comment creation and deletion
- Error handling for non-existent items
- Proper API responses

## Security Considerations

- No authentication is currently implemented
- Consider adding user permissions for delete operations
- Audit logging could be added for delete operations
- Rate limiting might be beneficial for delete endpoints

## Future Enhancements

1. **Soft Delete**: Instead of permanent deletion, mark items as deleted
2. **Bulk Operations**: Delete multiple items at once
3. **Undo Functionality**: Allow users to restore recently deleted items
4. **User Permissions**: Restrict deletion based on user roles
5. **Audit Trail**: Log all deletion activities
